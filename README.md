===================

*Deployment of RadarrAPI is done manually to https://radarr.aeonlucid.com/ by [@AeonLucid](https://github.com/AeonLucid)*.

This is the services API of [https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr). The API is created from scratch and not based on [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr) because it's not open-source.

The most important task of this API is to provide auto-updating to Radarr.

## Development
